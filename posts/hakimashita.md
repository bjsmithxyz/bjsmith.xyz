<p>About a decade ago I was working in a job where I had considerable downtime in front of a computer. Naturally, I decided that the best way to spend my time was to draw things in MS Paint. In this time, my colleagues and I would shitpost via email to each other.
Fast forward a few months and I had gained notoriety in my small team for my MS Paint skillz, at this stage a mate asked for me to draw something for his girlfriend. I ignored what he requested and drew this weird shit instead</p><code class="language-js">lmao</code>
